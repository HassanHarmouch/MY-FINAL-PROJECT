"Build a MERN stack web application using React (JSX), Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB Atlas that serves as a recycling assistance platform. The application should include the following core features:

1. User Registration (Optional)
Users can access the Recycling Center Locator without registering.

Registration is only required for users who want to request a pickup service.

Implement authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure login/logout.

Store user data securely in MongoDB Atlas.

2. Recycling Center Locator
Allow users to enter their location (via search bar or geolocation API).

Display a list of nearby recycling centers based on their input.

Each center should include contact details (phone number, WhatsApp link).

Implement filters for material type: plastic, paper, glass, or metal.

Use a Google Maps API (or OpenStreetMap API) for visualization.

Optimize the search functionality with MongoDB’s geospatial indexing.

3. Direct Communication with Recyclers
Show contact details for each center (phone number, WhatsApp link).

Ensure one-click communication (no in-app chat required).

Use dynamic links for WhatsApp API integration.

4. Reward System
Implement a points system based on the type and amount of recyclables submitted.

Store user reward points in MongoDB.

Allow users to redeem points for discounts, vouchers, or eco-friendly products.

Admin dashboard to manage reward programs.

5. Smart Notifications & Reminders
Notify users about new recycling centers, promotions, and environmental news.

Set up personalized reminders to recycle based on their past activity.

Use Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or Web Push Notifications.

6. Eco-Friendly Tips & Insights
A dedicated section for articles, videos, and tips on sustainable living.

Content should be dynamically fetched from a CMS or a database.

Personalize recommendations based on the user’s recycling habits.

Technical Requirements:
Frontend: React.js with JSX, React Router for navigation, and Material UI for design.

Backend: Node.js with Express.js as the API framework.

Database: MongoDB Atlas for scalable cloud storage.

Authentication: JWT-based user authentication.

Geolocation API: Google Maps API (or OpenStreetMap) for location-based searches.

Push Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or a WebSockets-based solution.

Hosting: Deploy frontend on Vercel/Netlify, backend on Render/Heroku, and database on MongoDB Atlas.

Bonus Enhancements:
Add an Admin Dashboard to manage recycling center data and user rewards.

Integrate AI-powered image recognition to detect recyclable materials.

Support multi-language options for a wider audience.

Ensure the application is secure, responsive, and optimized for performance. Provide well-structured API endpoints and follow best practices in MERN stack development."
